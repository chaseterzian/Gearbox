FILE UPLOAD AND save
TO STRABELIZE PLOT AVErAGE OF 20 OR SO PREVIOUS POINTS PER POINTS
SAVING DIV TEXT TO ARRAY FOR A REPORT
//EACH DATA POINT IS 1/100 OF A SECIND
PULL REG FROM MYSELF ???

UI CHOOSING THINGS



SERVER	
    -content doesnt work, do I even need one considering the following:

CONVERTING 
	-do not know how to access the data so that I can convert it.

// GRABBING PHONE DATA
// 	-live feed eliminates need to save, move, and drop file to be interpreted
// 	-android dev docs not clear

GRABBING THE FILE IN GENERAL
	-import through browser window, store in a variable
	-convert
	-run as normal

	-import thorugh browser window, save file.
	-convert(somehow, would need to convert the file into a new one or on import?)
	-run

	-live feed from device
	-convert on import
	-run

// STYLE
// 	-roataing compas (image possible)
// 	-video for demo?
// 	-transforming box for car orientation


MISC ISSUES
	-image on canvas - that moves with it
	-print long line data also
	-make the location coordinates managable
	-how to put the text divs on the same line
	-: in the csv's - time after date
	-where to put the files in express and how to link them
	-same for rails
	-do I need a server?
	-teas.js - thought this was an import solution
